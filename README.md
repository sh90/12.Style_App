# 🎨 Style Transfer Web App 

A hands-on Streamlit app that applies the **artistic style** of one image to another using **Neural Style Transfer (NST)**.  
We will use **Python + PyCharm** for this project.

---

##  What You’ll Learn
- The intuition behind **content** vs **style** in images
- How to reuse a **pre-trained VGG19** network for feature extraction
- How **Gram matrices** capture texture/style
- Pixel-level optimization with **PyTorch**
- Building a simple, interactive **Streamlit** app

---

##  Quick Start

> Recommended Python: 3.12

```

# 1) Install deps 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2) Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Then open the local URL printed by Streamlit. Upload a **content** image and a **style** image, or use the samples.

##  How It Works 

1. **Load Pre-trained VGG19**  
   We don’t train a CNN from scratch. We take a VGG19 trained on ImageNet and **use it as a fixed feature extractor**.

2. **Extract Features**  
   - **Content features** from a deep layer (e.g., `conv4_2`) represent structure/layout.
   - **Style features** from multiple layers (`conv1_1`…`conv5_1`) capture textures & colors.

3. **Gram Matrix for Style**  
   For each style layer, we compute a **Gram matrix** (feature correlations). Matching these encourages similar textures.

4. **Losses**  
   - **Content Loss:** Keep output close to content features.  
   - **Style Loss:** Match Gram matrices to style image.  
   - **Total Variation (TV) Loss:** Make the output smooth/pleasant.

5. **Optimize Pixels**  
   Start from the content image and **optimize the output pixels** using Adam for N steps.

6. **Preview Progress**  
   The Streamlit app shows intermediate previews and a progress bar.

###  Setup
- Create virtualenv, install requirements
- Launch `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

###  The Idea
- Content vs Style:  sample images can be refered
- VGG19 as a feature extractor (no training!)
- Style via Gram matrices 

###  Code Walkthrough 
- `streamlit_app.py`: file uploaders, sliders, progress callback
- Parameters: steps, style strength, content strength, TV (smoothness)

### Code Walkthrough 
- `nst.py`: 
  - Which VGG layers are used and why
  - Content/Style losses, TV loss
  - Optimization loop
- `utils.py`: preprocessing & device selection

###  Run Experiments
- Try small sizes (256/320) & 100–150 steps
- Change style strength & TV weight and observe effects
- Discuss CPU vs GPU/MPS (Apple Silicon) speeds

### Additionl experiments
- Try different content/style images
- Increase steps to improve output
- Tweak which style layers are used
  

##  Parameters to Try

- **Max image size**: 256–512 (CPU: prefer ≤384)  
- **Steps**: 100–300 (more steps = better but slower)  
- **Style weight**: `1e5` to `1e7`  
- **TV weight**: `0` to `1e-3` (more = smoother)

---

## Running from CLI 

```bash
python nst_cli.py --content samples/content.jpg --style samples/style.jpg --out stylized.jpg --size 384 --steps 150
```

---

##  Troubleshooting

- **Slow on CPU?**  
  Reduce image size and steps. Close other apps.
- **`use_container_width` error in Streamlit**  
  Some older versions don’t support that flag. This app uses `use_column_width=True` for wider compatibility.
- **“CUDA not available”?**  
  The app auto-detects device. It runs on CPU, CUDA, or Apple MPS.

##  Where Is This Used?
- Creative photo apps & filters
- Design ideation & concept art
- Education/teaching neural representations
- Lightweight artistic effects in mobile/desktop tools
